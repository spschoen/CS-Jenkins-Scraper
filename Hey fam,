Hey fam,

So you have two .xml files for findbugs and checkstyle. The ones that 
you copied into this directory, and another in the CashRegister file.
The parsers I have started works off of the ones in the CashRegister and moved it to the same directory as this message. (You can move them
I just wanted to show you which ones)

For both the FindBugs and PMD parser, the for loop is being a bit of a bitch, but it
should be getting all the data we need. I think it’s because I’m a node too far in, 
if that makes sense.
